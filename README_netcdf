1.) Introduction

The data in this repository is provided through the efforts of the
European Centre for Medium term Weather Forecasts ECMWF
https://www.ecmwf.int
It contains only wind data at different barometric altitude levels over
a grid of geocoordiunates over Europe, and over the timeframe 2011-2017.
It can be used to assess the wind potential for different (High altitude)
wind power generatuon technologies.

2.) Data source

For a detailed description of the ERA5 analysis of a full atmospheric model
can be found here:
https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/archive-datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5
For an assessment of th wind data in this analysis, see the preprint
of the publication
https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07718

3.) Data format

the file naming convention is

output_<year>_<location>_<month>.netcdf

The wind data are stored in the netcdf4 format:
https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/
The analysis can be portformed using the netcdf4 python module:
http://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/

The data contains the following variables of interest:
u: wind speed in [m/s] in the east/west direction
v: wind speed in [m/s] in the north/south direction

These variables are stored for the following space-time coordinates:
- for each geolocation in a 1x1 degree grid within
  N20  - N65 degrees
  W-20 - W20 degrees
- for the following altitude levels in [m] above sea level:

- for each hour in the month stated in the file name, starting
  with 0:00 on the first day of the month and ending with
  23:00 on the last day of the month
